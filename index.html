<h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2>
<p>Spring Creek Asset Management is a leading investment management firm that was founded in 2022 in Plano, TX. We focus on delivering strong returns for our clients through a combination of fundamental analysis and quantitative strategies.</p>

<h2 id="investment-strategy">Investment Strategy</h2>
<p>Our investment strategy is built on a foundation of strong fundamental analysis, which involves closely examining the financial and economic factors that drive the performance of a particular security or market. This approach allows us to identify undervalued assets that are likely to experience strong growth in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to fundamental analysis, we also employ a variety of quantitative strategies to generate returns. These include statistical arbitrage, algorithmic trading, and high-frequency trading. By combining both fundamental and quantitative strategies, we are able to identify and capitalize on opportunities in the market that others may miss.</p>
